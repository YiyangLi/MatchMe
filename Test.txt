http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=C@gmail.com&Symbol=MSFT&Volume=5&OrderType=Limit&Price=2&OrderSide=Buy

Order turn to New, waiting

http://localhost:86/db/GetUserInfo?UserName=C@gmail.com
Balance remains the same, while the order is alive:
http://localhost:86/db/GetLiveOrders

(Market asks for 25 to sell, but the trade C offer only 2 to buy)


******************************

*************Test 5, now A contains 5 AAPL, B contains 5 IBM, C contains nothing ************
http://localhost:86/db/GetPosition

A wants to profit, asking for 200 to sell:
http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=A@gmail.com&Symbol=AAPL&Volume=5&OrderType=Limit&Price=200&OrderSide=Sell

Order goes alive, waiting for buyer: 
http://localhost:86/db/GetLiveOrders

well, C could accept it, whatever the price is, 
http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=C@gmail.com&Symbol=AAPL&Volume=5&OrderType=Market&OrderSide=Buy

the order is filled, the alive order from A is filled, while it's moved to C's position:
http://localhost:86/db/GetLiveOrders
http://localhost:86/db/GetPosition

A doesn't have any positions, let's check A's balance:
http://localhost:86/db/GetUserInfo?UserName=A@gmail.com

great, A profits 500 totally, but he has to pay $6 as commission to brokers. 


***************************

*************Test 6, AAPL becomes very popular************

B wants to buy it, he prefers to offer $250, and long 2 shares

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=B@gmail.com&Symbol=AAPL&Volume=2&OrderType=Limit&Price=250&OrderSide=Buy


the order is hanging there as C is waiting for a more generous buyer, here A comes:

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=A@gmail.com&Symbol=AAPL&Volume=2&OrderType=Limit&Price=300&OrderSide=Buy

Wow, A could offer 300, C can't wait to sell it. 

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=C@gmail.com&Symbol=AAPL&Volume=2&OrderType=Market&OrderSide=Sell

Nice shot! now, A gets 2 AAPL, B still holds IBM, C gets 3 AAPL:

***************************

*************Test 7, let's play some complicated, there is a new rising star called GOOG *******


http://localhost:86/action/AddCompany?Symbol=GOOG&Volume=5&Price=1000.00

everyone wants to get it, including the new trader L:

http://localhost:86/action/AddUser?UserName=L@gmail.com&Balance=10000.00

He spends half of his balance to get all GOOG. 

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=L@gmail.com&Symbol=GOOG&Volume=5&OrderType=Market&OrderSide=Buy

He wants to profits, so he sets a limit sell order @2000

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=L@gmail.com&Symbol=GOOG&Volume=2&OrderType=Limit&Price=2000&OrderSide=Sell

C doesn't buy the deal, he is enjoying the apple deal, However, A and B are interested in GOOG:

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=A@gmail.com&Symbol=GOOG&Volume=2&OrderType=Limit&Price=1800&OrderSide=Buy

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=B@gmail.com&Symbol=GOOG&Volume=2&OrderType=Limit&Price=1900&OrderSide=Buy

The orders are alive but none are filled:

http://localhost:86/db/GetLiveOrders


C then realized difference between a hardware company and an Internet company, C can't wait to get the deal, placing a market order on GOOG:

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=C@gmail.com&Symbol=GOOG&Volume=2&OrderType=Market&OrderSide=Buy

now, C gets it.

L has 3 remaining GOOG, C has 2 GOOG, L profits a lot from it, let's check everyone's balance:
http://localhost:86/db/GetUserInfo

L wants to clean the position, he places a market sell order to match A and B's requests:

http://localhost:86/action/PlaceAnOrder?UserName=L@gmail.com&Symbol=GOOG&Volume=3&OrderType=Market&OrderSide=Sell

So, there is a buy order waiting to be matched, which is A's order @1800.
